gst-sdr-j-fm is a GStreamer wrapper/fork around the SDR-J FM receiver.
It provides ability to playback FM radio from signal acquires from devices
supported by the RTL SDR projects. Demodulation is done in software re-using
code initially found in the SDR-J software.

To use it, you need GStreamer 1.0.

Install the GStreamer 1.0 dev packages, then just build and install this module.

For example, again on Raspbian:

./autogen --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install

Then, you can try out the playing fm radio:

gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=fm:///99.9

gst-inspect-1.0 sdrjfmsrc to get an idea of the properties that have been
implemented.

See the REQUIREMENTS file for the full list of build requirements.
